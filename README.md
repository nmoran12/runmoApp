# runmoApp (previously Runr)

NOTE: The old name for this project was called "Runr", however that seems to be already taken by a running company so my new name is "Runmo". If you see Runr alot in files or file names, I am in the process of fixing that.

This is a running app that I have created for educational purposes


# Runmo - iOS Running App
