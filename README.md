# runrApp (now Runmo)

NOTE: The old name for this project was called "Runr", however that seems to be already taken by a running company so my new name is "Runmo". If you see Runr alot in files or file names, I am in the process of fixing that.

This is a running app that I have created for educational purposes


# Runmo - iOS Running App

Runmo is an iOS running app designed to inspire and connect runners. Runmo lets users track their runs in real time, compare stats on leaderboards, and stay connected with friendsâ€”all while pursuing personal goals and accessing advanced running insights.
