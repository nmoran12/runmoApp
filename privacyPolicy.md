##Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy — Runmo

Effective: August 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Runmo (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Runmo iOS app (the “App”).

1) What we collect

We collect the minimum data needed to create your account, operate the App, and save your runs.

Account & Profile

Email address

Username and display name (if provided)

Firebase user ID

Activity Data

Run metrics (time, distance, pace, elevation, optional caption)

Route coordinates recorded during a run (precise location)

Gear notes (if you add them)

Device & App Info

Basic device and app identifiers needed to keep you signed in and secure

Error/diagnostic logs (only to fix issues)

We do not collect your contacts, photos, or advertising identifiers, and we do not sell your data.

2) How we use your data

Create and secure your account and let you sign in (email, Apple, or Google)

Record and display your runs, leaderboards, and profile stats, appear in searches in app

Sync your data across devices via our backend

Provide support and improve reliability (diagnostics)

3) Location data

The App uses precise location to record routes and compute distance/pace.

While Using the App permission enables live tracking with the screen on.

Always Allow (background) lets a run continue when the screen is off.
Location is used only to record your activity and show your route; it is not used for advertising or tracking you across other apps.

4) Legal bases (EEA/UK only)

Our legal bases are performance of a contract (providing the App), and legitimate interests (security, diagnostics). Where required, we rely on your consent for precise/background location.

5) Sharing & third parties

We share data only with service providers that help us run the App:

Firebase (Google LLC) — Authentication and Cloud Firestore database to store your account and run data; encrypted in transit and at rest.

Sign in with Apple / Google Sign-In — optional authentication providers.

Apple Maps / Core Location — to display maps and obtain location.

These providers process data on our behalf under contractual safeguards. We don’t share data with advertisers.

6) Data retention

Account & profile: kept until you delete your account in the App.

Runs and routes: kept until you delete them or delete your account.

Diagnostics: typically retained up to 30–90 days for troubleshooting.

When you delete your account (Profile → ••• → Delete Account), we delete your authentication record and remove or anonymize associated data stored in our database (runs, goals, programs, chats you own).

7) Your choices & rights

Access, correct, delete your data: available in-app (Delete Account) or by contacting us at ☐support@yourdomain.com.

Location permissions: change anytime in iOS Settings → Privacy → Location Services → Runmo.

Export: email us to request a copy of your data.

Residents of California, the EEA/UK, and other regions may have additional rights. We do not “sell” or “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

8) Children

Runmo is intended for users 13+ (or the minimum age in your region). We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age.

9) Security

We use industry-standard security including TLS in transit, encryption at rest via Firebase, and access controls (Firestore security rules). No method is 100% secure.

10) International transfers

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where our providers operate. We rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs for EEA/UK users).

11) Changes

We may update this policy. We’ll post the updated version and change the Effective date above. Material changes will be highlighted in-app where reasonable.
